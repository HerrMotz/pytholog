The aim of the library is to explore ways to use symbolic reasoning with machine learning.
I am very interested in the **Neuro-Symbolic AI** field and I developed this library aiming at discovering ways to
combine AI with its modern approaches using Neural Networks and the GOFAI Symbolic AI. 

Contribution, new ideas, collaboration and any kind of help will be much appreciated. 
I am actually looking for contributors because I believe working in a team make you more creative than working alone.

When contributing to this repository, if possible but not required, please first let's discuss together the change you wish to make 
via issue, email, or any other method you prefer. I would like to learn from you. 

There is still a lot to do to enhance the library and a lot to be adopted from prolog like the **list processing and operations**. 

## When creating a Pull Request please:

1. Update the README.md with some explanation about the changes or fixes you made and/or added.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that your
   Pull Request would represent.
